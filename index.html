<p>Nicki Minaj,<b>original name Onika Tanya Maraj,(born December 8, 1982, St. James,Trinidad and Tobago),Trinidadian-born singer, songwriter, television personality,and actress who was known for her flowing quick-spoken rap style and for her provocative lyrics.</b> 
She complemented her music with a bold persona that included colourful wigs and risqué clothing.<i>Maraj was about five years old when her family moved to Queens, New York, from Trinidad and Tobago. Her childhood was dominated by a violent drug-addicted father, <u>and she spent time creating fantasies for herself that would allow her an escape from her tumultuous life.</u> She adopted a new name, Nicki Minaj, from that practice. Other creative outlets included writing her first rap song when she was 12 years old and pursuing acting at New York City’s Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts</i>.</p><br/><br/>
